Unofficial No Man's Sky Bug Tracker

As the title indicates, this is an attempt at creating an unofficial bug tracker for the game No Man's Sky that folks may contribute to using Github's Issues feature. This is a work-in-progress, however, so will be making adjustments to improve it as time permits.
